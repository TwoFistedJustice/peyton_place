# Peyton Place

This is a Markdown and PlantUML repo to help me keep track of locations, characters, and relationships
in the 1956 novel Peyton Place by Grace Metalious

When I think a location in the book is inspired by a real place, I will include a link if it still exists
and I know where it may be.
