# Peyton Place

This is a Markdown and PlantUML repo to help me keep track of locations, characters, and relationships
in the 1956 novel Peyton Place by Grace Metalious

When I think a location in the book is inspired by a real place, I will include a link if it still exists
and I know where it may be.

The story seems to be semi-autobiographical. It begins in the autumn of 1936. Book 1 ends on June 20th, 1937. 
Book 2 picks up two years later.


Ages given are in 1937.

The [famous photo](https://cultfilmalley.com.au/2021/05/06/the-genius-of-writer-grace-metalious-and-return-to-peyton-place-1961-part-two/) 
of the author in front of the white cupolaed building was taken at the former [Gilmanton Public Library](https://maps.app.goo.gl/eFe6Tq4PYgyaWjJk8)




## IRL Peyton Place
The town is fictional, but clearly inspired by a cluster of town in New Hampshire.

Since White River (White River Junction?) is clearly the next town over, and the Connecticut River is visible from
Peyton Place, I speculate the imaginary location is where IRL Canaan is. There's no physical resemblance between them.
But I guess that since PP is clearly a den of iniquity, the author chose Canaan as a nod to the Biblical Canaan.

The name Peyton Place may have been inspired by Gardner's Grove, a small town near (now part of) Belmont NH.

### [Belmont, NH](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BB4L4taLdNsgF2P67)
The bookend churches are clearly in Belmont, NH. The author didn't even change the name of
one of them. Today both churches match their physical description in the book right down to
the gold cross on one of them.

### [Gilmanton NH](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qJ6YMt4ynNjZBTPZ7)
According to residents at the time of publication, the characters and dramas were clearly drawn from
the actual people of Gilmanton, where the author happened to live.

### [Tilton NH](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3Kd4cjTDET1gdBQ49)
Many street names match and to some extent the town layout. The houses in Tilton look to be of the
right age and style to match those described in the book.

**[Gardner's Grove NH](https://maps.app.goo.gl/SeCGSGYWVs2oYAeS9)** I think the name Peyton Place was inspired by this town.

## Places:


**Citizens National Bank**: located across from courthouse. Has the town clock. Corner of Elm and Maple?

**Cumberland Mills**: Harrington's business.

**Congregational Church**: White steepled protestant church.

[Tilton Congregational Church](https://maps.app.goo.gl/YW7eaQrFrM4oAUWr6) Probably this is the one which inspired the one
in the book, though the bookend layout is from the Baptist church in Belmont.

[Baptist Church in Belmont](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Vod1g2HWYf1yBtrb8) fits the bookend layout in Chapter 1

**Courthouse**: old domed building, greenish roof. Old men congregate here. Located at corner of Elm and Maple.

**Five and Ten Cent Store**: the 1930s version of a dollar store. 

**Hyde's Diner**: The nightime meeting spot.

**[Mary Hitchcock Hospital](./assets/mary-hitchcock-hospital.jpg)**: Hospital in Hanover NH where Doc Swain cut his teeth. Built 1893. Demolished in 1995

**Peyton Place Hospital**: Doc Swain's demesne.

**Peyton Place Times**: located across from courthouse.  First floor. Corner of Elm and Maple?

**Road's End**: Up the hill east of town, where the road ends at a wooden plank. A woody, rocky area largely ignored by
town folk. Allison MacKenzie's secret alone-place. Also the local make out point for teen parking.

[**St. Joseph's Church**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xPiAnfgjac5kMdfK8): Catholic, topped with a golden cross.

**Schoolhouse**: old wooden schoolhouse. Houses the grade school. (up to 9th grade) Located at the end of Maple St.

**Thrifty Corner Apparel Shoppe** - Allison MacKenzie's mother's (Constance Standish) shop on East Elm. Where most
of the town ladies buy their clothes. 

**Train Station**: 19th century construction. Interior decorated with golden oak all about.

**[White River](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8Ufig2HhrYRhYHPT6)**: nearby town where people go to buy booze.



## Streets
**Beech St** Runs south from the middle of East Elm. Residential. Has street lights. Allison lives here.

**Chestnut St**: Runs East/West one block south of Elm. Posh houses. The west end of the street is where Harringtong
and Swain live.

**Depot St**: North side is industry. South sid is houses. Evidently a hotbed of gossip and petty rivalry. The Pages live
here. Probably on the west side of Maple since Norman was surprised to see Allison.

**Elm Street** : Main business district, lined with shops with awnings. Six blocks long. Bookended by competing churches.

**Laurel**: Rhodes lives on this street.

**Maple Street**: Bisects Elm St. Second nicest street in PP. Lined with trees and houses. Dead ends into a field. End has the grade school
on one side and the high school on the other.


## Tensions

**Tar Paper Shacks**
Tar paper shacks are where the poor live. Some say live and let live, mostly those who want to exploit the residents. And others cite
that they are generally unsanitary and pose a public health hazard due to risk of disease. Harrington is in favor of letting them be.
Buswell and Swain want zoning laws to force the residents to upgrade their dwellings. They generally exist outside the town proper, but
within town jurisdiction.

**Page Family** Evidently they all hate each other just for being alive and related to one another. The Page sisters hate Norman and
because their father shagged his mother resulting in him.

## Map Notes
I have the residential streets too far away from maple. There should be two N/S streets on either side of maple.
Depot street definitely runs north and south of elm. Probably the others do as well. Depot is probably the 1st street
east of Maple. 

Train station is on North Depot St, two blocks north from Elm.

Cumberland Mills is probably near the train station since they will need to load freight.

Beech Street is probably east of Maple. It is not the most easterly st bc in ch3 Allison is heading west from Road's End
and the "next street" is hers, implying a previous st. So probably from West to East the order is Depot, Beech, Maple. Allison
most likely lives near the end of the first block south of maple.

The page sisters live on the corner of Elm and Depot, no doubt on the south side.


Hyde's diner is 3 blocks west of Depot street. Which puts Depot St east of Maple.

Thrifty Corner shop is probably on the west side of Elm because Selena followed Doc Swain home from the shop. Which implies that
it lay between his house on West Chestnut and either the hospital or PP times.

**hospital** located a mile off of Elm on Route 406, a 3 laned highway to white river


**Carter house** - two blocks north of schools on Maple
