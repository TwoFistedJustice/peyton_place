# Peyton Place

This is a Markdown and PlantUML repo to help me keep track of locations, characters, and relationships
in the 1956 novel Peyton Place by Grace Metalious

When I think a location in the book is inspired by a real place, I will include a link if it still exists
and I know where it may be.

## Places:


**Citizens National Bank**: located across from courthouse. Has the town clock. Corner of Elm and Maple?

**Cumberland Mills**: Harrington's business.

[**Congregational Church**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Vod1g2HWYf1yBtrb8): White steepled protestant church.

**Courthouse**: old domed building, greenish roof. Old men congregate here. Located at corner of Elm and Maple.

**Peyton Place Times**: located across from courthouse.  First floor. Corner of Elm and Maple?

**Road's End**: Up the hill east of town, where the road ends at a wooden plank. A woody, rocky area largely ignored by
town folk. Allison MacKenzie's secret alone-place. Also the local make out point for teen parking.

[**St. Joseph's Church**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xPiAnfgjac5kMdfK8): Catholic, topped with a golden cross.

**Schoolhouse**: old wooden schoolhouse. Houses the grade school. (up to 9th grade) Located at the end of Maple St.

**Thrifty Corner Apparel Shoppe** - Allison MacKenzie's mother's (Constance Standish) shop on East Elm. Where most
of the town ladies buy their clothes. 


## Streets
**Beech St** Runs south from the middle of East Elm. Residential. Has street lights. Allison lives here.

**Chestnut St**: Runs East/West one block south of Elm. Posh houses. The west end of the street is where Harringtong
and Swain live.

**Depot St**: Evidently a hotbed of gossip and petty rivalry. The Pages live here.

**Elm Street** : main business district, line with shops with awnings. Six blocks long. Bookended by competing churches.

**Maple Street**: Bisects Elm St. Lined with trees and houses. Dead ends into a field. End has the grade school
on one side and the high school on the other.


## Tensions

**Tar Paper Shacks**
Tar paper shacks are where the poor live. Some say live and let live, mostly those who want to exploit the residents. And others cite
that they are generally unsanitary and pose a public health hazard due to risk of disease. Harrington is in favor of letting them be.
Buswell and Swain want zoning laws to force the residents to upgrade their dwellings. They generally exist outside the town proper, but
within town jurisdiction.

**Page Family** Evidently they all hate each other just for being alive and related to one another. The Page sisters hate Norman and
because their father shagged his mother resulting in him.
